    "You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.\n",

    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "sentences = [\"alice and bob love leetcode\", \"i think so too\", \"this is great thanks very much\"]\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "6\n",
    "#### Explanation: \n",
    "- The first sentence, \"alice and bob love leetcode\", has 5 words in total.\n",

    "- The third sentence, \"this is great thanks very much\", has 6 words in total.\n",
