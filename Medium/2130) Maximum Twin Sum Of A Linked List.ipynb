    "# MAXIMUM TWIN SUM OF A LINKED LIST\n",
    "\n",
    "In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.\n",
    "The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: \n",
    "head = [5,4,2,1]\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "6\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.\n",
    "There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.\n",
    "Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. \n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: \n",
    "head = [4,2,2,3]\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "7\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:\n",
    "- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.\n",
    "- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. \n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: \n",
    "head = [1,100000]\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "100001\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].\n",
    "1 <= Node.val <= 105"
