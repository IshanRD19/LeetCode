    "You want to water n plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i. There is a river at x = -1 that you can refill your watering can at.\n",

    "Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Water the plants in order from left to right.\n",
    "After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.\n",
