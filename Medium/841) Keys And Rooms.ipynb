    "# KEYS AND ROOMS\n",

    "There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.\n",

    "#### Input: \n",
    "rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "false\n",
    "#### Explanation: \n",
    "We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.\n",
